# FramiOS

**NOTE:** FramiOS is a work in progress and in a very early stage. Any suggestions or PRs are more then welcomed!

## Basic usage

- Download the repository
- Copy the components you want to use in the `modules` folder
- Add the `require` expressions to your files (you can check each module documentation for that)
