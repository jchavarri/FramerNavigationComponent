# FramiOS

iOS based components for Framer. They have a default behavior and look, but can be easily customized.

**NOTE:** FramiOS is a work in progress and in a very early stage. Any suggestions or PRs are more then welcomed!

## Basic usage

- Download the repository
- Copy the components you want to use in the `modules` folder
- Add the `require` expressions to your files (you can check each module documentation for that)

## Components

### Navigation Component

Implements a navigation component with a similar default configuration as the iOS one. All its behavior and styles are easily customized, both for the animations between layers and the header layer.
